# Curved Surface Reconstruction Library
Obtaining suitable optical access to the test section is crucial for capturing multi-dimensional flow behavior, such as depicting shock structures and surface-flow responses to shock boundary layer interactions. This requires specialized facility design and arrangement, which can be particularly challenging for test sections with complex geometries, such as blade cascades and non-flat nozzle walls. The proposed method aims to flatten the suction side of a constant chord airfoil using a single camera view to obtain a true scale-mapped surface of the airfoil.


This library employes OpenCV, scipy, glob, sys, numpy and matplotlib libraries.
